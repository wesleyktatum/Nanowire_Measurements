## Big Picture Design  (Nick)
- Feed in data file (SEM, TEM, SPM, etc.)
- Use edge detection and depth detection algorithms to determine height and width of objects in micrographs (e.g. nanowires, nanoparticles)
- Ideally, this software can read any image and determine the width and height of any "picture" of any object, given appropriate scale
- ???
- Profit

## Use Cases  
- Measure height of nanowires (Yatong)  
- Measure the width of the nanowires (Arushi) . 

## About the Data (Wes)
