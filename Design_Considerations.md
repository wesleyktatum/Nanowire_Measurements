## Big Picture Design  (Nick)
- Feed in data file (SEM, TEM, SPM, etc.)
- Use edge detection and depth detection algorithms to determine height and width of objects in micrographs (e.g. nanowires, nanoparticles)
- Ideally, this software can read any image and determine the width and height of any "picture" of any object, given appropriate scale
- ???
- Profit

## Use Cases  
- Measure height of nanowires (Yatong)
 - Use Case Name: Height Measurement of Nanowires
 - Actor: user, the program we are about to build
 - Description: The user will upload the data from Atomic Force Microscope of nanowires into the program. The program will then identify the intensity difference, screen out the special situation in which there is, for example, an overlap of nanowires, a random bent of nanowires or a lift by nods that causes the height to rise, and at last return the accurate average height of nanowires inside the scan size. 

- Measure the width of the nanowires (Arushi) .
